To switch your domain so malware makes a request to your host instead of an actual domain.

1. Edit C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts as root
2. Set 127.0.0.1 to the domain the malware is trying to call out to

With this set up you are probably going to want to set up ncat to listen

``` 
ncat -nvlp 443
```
